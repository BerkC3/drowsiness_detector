# Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System

# NOTE: dlib-bin provides pre-compiled wheels so no C++ compiler is needed.
#       If dlib-bin fails for your Python version, install the .whl manually:

#
# NOTE: For GPU training with CUDA, install PyTorch separately FIRST:
#       pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
#       Then install the rest:  pip install -r requirements.txt
